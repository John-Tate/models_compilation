# Logistic Regression:

Logistic Regression is an application of the linear model to classification problems.

From Wikipedia:

>Logistic regression can be seen as a special case of the generalized linear model and thus analogous to linear >regression. The model of logistic regression, however, is based on quite different assumptions (about the relationship >between dependent and independent variables) from those of linear regression. In particular the key differences of >these two models can be seen in the following two features of logistic regression. First, the conditional distribution >{\displaystyle y\mid x} y\mid x is a Bernoulli distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution, because the dependent >variable is binary. Second, the predicted values are probabilities and are therefore restricted to (0,1) through the >logistic distribution function because logistic regression predicts the probability of particular outcomes.
